Title: GNEProp Escherichia coli antibiotic activity
Description: The GNEProp model was trained based on a high-throughput screening effort
  against a sensitized Escherichia coli strain. The model was able to identify new
  antibiotic candidates in a billion-scale screening effort. small-molecule high-throughput
  screening with a deep-learning-based virtual screening approach to uncover new antibacterial
  compounds. Robustness of the model was validated with respect to out-of-distribution
  generalization and activity cliff prediction.
